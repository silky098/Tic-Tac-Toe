**Project**

The project was to create a game application called Tic Tac Toe.

The game is compatible with the latest versions of:

* Firefox
* chrome
* Safari
* IE

The game begins with a game board and an X tile is displayed when a player clicks in any of the 9 squares. The player is then switched to O, and therefore when the next square is clicked, an O tile will be displayed, and so on with alternate turns until there is a win or all nine tiles are filled with no winners.
A tile cannot be used twice in a single game.
A win is when either X or O have three tiles in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. A banner will be displayed to show a win.
When all tiles are filled but there's is no winner, it's 'cat's game', and a banner will be displayed to show this.

The reset button resets all the values so the game can be replayed.

**General Usage Notes**

Browser compatibility was tested with [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com)

**Game Limitations**

- The game currently always begins with an X, however the rules state that although the first game should always begin with player X, subsequent games should begin with the winner of the last game. Unfortunately this is not currently possible and may be remedied in a future release.
